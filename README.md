A new Flutter project.

Using this Project GetX State Mangement

GetX is not only a state management library, but instead, it is a microframework combined with route management and dependency injection. It aims to deliver top-of-the-line development experience in an extra lightweight but powerful solution for Flutter. GetX has three basic principles on which it is built:

    1.Performance: focused on minimum consumption of memory and resources
    2. Productivity: intuitive and efficient tool combined with simplicity and straightforward syntax that ultimately saves development time
    3.Organization: decoupling business logic from view and presentation logic cannot get better than this. You do not need context to navigate between routes, nor do you need stateful widgets
    
    
    Using Http Get Request
    Fetching data from the internet is necessary for most apps. Luckily, Dart and Flutter provide tools, such as the http package, for this type of work.

This recipe uses the following steps:

    1.Add the http package.
    2.Make a network request using the http package.
    3.Convert the response into a custom Dart object.
    4.Fetch and display the data with Flutter
